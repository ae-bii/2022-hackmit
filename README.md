Problems: Medical research would highly benefit from automation to detect patterns and eliminate the existing high rate of errors. Machine learning for diagnosis has proved to be significantly more accurate than medical professionals in certain situations. Our product would benefit those in the medical field through feedback, inspiration, and innovation.

Problem Statement: We see the need to make machine learning more accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers in medicine by developing a web community where they may share machine learning models with academic and industry professionals to improve innovation and public health.

Our solution is to provide healthcare professionals and researchers with a community to share their own ideas and utilize others. Allowing professionals access to existing machine learning models allows them to collaborate with others to share their ideas and utilize existing work. They may also choose to keep their data private, in order to utilize the automation in our product for their own research. Essentially, our web application for medical professionals would allow them to upload machine learning models, pull existing ones for their research, test individual or group data, and display performance metrics intuitively. Through this, we hope that the field of medicine and public health will greatly expand.
